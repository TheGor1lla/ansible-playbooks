# Playbooks

My setup for standardized apps across multiple Linux installations.

## Setup

To setup your localhost as the ansible main, execute:

```shell
ansible-playbook playbooks/01-host.yml

```

## Don't forget

Install the zsh fonts on host machine and tell your terminal to use it when using SSH to an ansible-deployed host.
